# Exercise Tracking Module (Wearable + Teensy Integration)

## Overview

This module is a **battery-powered wearable device** that tracks exercises using motion data and user input, then sends results to a central **Teensy 4.1 hub** over Bluetooth.

It supports:
- Rep-based exercises (pushups, curls, squats)
- Time-based exercises (plank, dead hang)
- Manual exercise selection via rotary encoder
- Visual feedback via OLED display
- Audio feedback via buzzer

# Software Design

## State Machine

SELECT_EXERCISE → SELECT_DURATION → READY_COUNTDOWN → ACTIVE_TIMER / REP_TRACKING → DONE

---

# User Flow

1. Rotate → select exercise
2. Click → confirm
3. (If timed) rotate → select duration
4. Click → confirm
5. 5-second countdown
6. Exercise runs (rep count or timer)
7. Completion → buzzer + display

# Bluetooth Data

Examples:

Rep-based:
pushups: 12 reps

Time-based:
plank: 45 sec

Recommended format:
exercise_complete: pushups,12

---

# Rep Detection

- Read IMU
- Smooth signal
- Detect peaks
- Count cycles

---

# Timer Logic

Use millis():

if (millis() - startTime >= duration) {
  // done
}

---

# Power Usage

~20–40 mA total

---

# Integration with Teensy

Teensy:
- Receives BLE data
- Displays info
- Logs to SD card

---

# Design Philosophy

User selects exercise → system tracks accurately

---

# Future Ideas

- Posture detection
- AI classification
- Multiple sensors

---

# Summary

- Accurate reps
- Timer support
- Simple UI
- Expandable system
